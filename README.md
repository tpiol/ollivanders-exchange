### Application Name: *Ollivander's Exchange*

### Description
Ollivanders Exchange is a Harry Potterâ€“inspired Django application where users can create and customize their own Wizards. Each Wizard has a detailed profile card, allowing users to seamlessly add, update, or remove wands. Wizards can also expand their magical abilities by learning new spells through a many-to-many relationship. Inspired by a love for the Wizarding World, this application immerses users in a Hogwarts-like experience where their imagination brings the magic to life.
